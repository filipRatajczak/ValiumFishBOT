# ValiumFishBOT

Using CNN network for digit recognize and WinApi for fetching data from memory.

# How to use:

* Keep game window active and set resolution to 1024x768 (working on it).
* RUN SCRIPT IN ADMIN RIGHTS (MANDATORY!)
* Neural network is created for quite low training date (~1k images) so script may be wrong sometimes
* Put worms in stack from F1 to F4 hotkey. Script randomizes the key to use.
* If you see that bot is stack you can help by starting fishing by yourself or just wait to run repairing script. (
  working on faster detecting stacks)
