# ValiumFishBOT

Using CNN network for digit recognize and WinApi for fetching data from memory.

# How to use:

* Keep game window active and set resolution to 1024x768 (working on it).
* Make sure that your neural network accuracy is decent (~90% val_accuracy) if not then keep restarting the app till
  reach it. In the future I'll create update that contains fully learned network that works in 99% cases.
* Put worms in stack from F1 to F4 hotkey. Script randomizes the key to use.
* If you see that bot is stack you can help by starting fishing by yourself or just wait to run repairing script. (
  working on faster detecting stacks)
